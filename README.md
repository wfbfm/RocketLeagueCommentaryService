This Discord bot powers the Rocket League Commentary Service!

Inspired by live text coverage of traditional sports, we aim to provide Rocket League fans
with insightful commentary alongside in-play highlights of all the action.

So, if you're unable to catch the broadcast - you don't need to worry about 
missing a thing!
