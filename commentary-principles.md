### Write impactful, high-quality comments

We want our readers to get the full viewing experience from your comments.
Bring it to life!

---

### Think beyond the pitch

Refrain from only describing the immediate action on the pitch.
Is the crowd loud?  Have analysts on the desk made some bold
predictions?

---

### We're all biased - but find balance

Nobody wants to read repeated spam of `NA>EU` or vice-versa.  Twitch
chat already exists.

---

### Twitch Clips should be used sparingly

We don't need to Clip every goal.  Think once-a-series, rather
than once-a-goal!

---

### No forms of abuse will be tolerated

Remember that behind every screen is a human.
Bad actors will be banned immediately.
