Inspired by live text coverage of traditional sports, we aim to provide Rocket League fans
with insightful commentary alongside in-play highlights of all the action.

So, if you're unable to catch the broadcast - you don't need to worry about 
missing a thing!

The service is run by volunteers, and we need your help to keep 
on top of the hectic RLCS schedule - so please consider
becoming a commentator today!

## Become a Commentator

To get access to the suite of commentary tools, you need the **Commentator** role in the Discord server.

This can be granted by any admin, on request.  Give us a shout, and we'll sort it out!

In the meantime - please join the general discussion, and enjoy the commentary and highlights provided by the other volunteers!
